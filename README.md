# Parsing_project
The goal of the project is to scrape results for Formula 1 races for all of its history starting from the year 1950 until now. The data to be scraped includes basic information about the race itself (season, location, full name, date, track name), driversâ€™ finishing positions, team names, number of points gained, number of laps completed and time at finish.

Formula1.com is the official website for Formula 1, the starting page to be used in this project is the results archive: https://www.formula1.com/en/results/archive-1950-2016.html
